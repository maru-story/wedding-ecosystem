## Usage Tips for AI Assistants

1. **Start here** — This index has enough context to determine which file answers a question
2. **Read selectively** — Only load the specific file(s) relevant to the current task
3. **Cross-reference** — Workflows reference components and interfaces; follow the links
4. **For implementation tasks** — Read `components.md` first to locate code, then `interfaces.md` for contracts
5. **For debugging** — Read `workflows.md` to understand the expected flow, then `components.md` to find the code
6. **For new features** — Read `architecture.md` for patterns to follow, `data_models.md` for schema, `interfaces.md` for API conventions
