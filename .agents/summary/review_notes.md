# Review Notes

## Consistency Check

### ✅ Consistent Across Documents

- **Tech stack versions** — All documents reference the same pinned versions (Next.js 16.2, Fastify 5, Prisma 7.7, Socket.io 4.8, etc.)
- **Architecture terminology** — Consistent use of "tenant isolation", "room-based WebSocket", "offline-first" across all files
- **Zero-Cast Repository Policy** — Repositories now use explicit Prisma types; `as any` has been eliminated (Verified July 2026)
- **Standardized Error Envelope** — All API errors now return a consistent JSON shape with `ErrorCode` enum values
- **Package names** — Consistent `@wedding/*` naming convention throughout
- **Port assignments** — Dashboard :3000, Scanner :3002, API :4000 consistent everywhere
- **Scale constraints** — 1 event, 500 guests, single instance consistently documented
- **Enum values** — All 11 enums match between `data_models.md` and `interfaces.md`
- **API endpoint patterns** — Routes in `interfaces.md` match the service responsibilities in `components.md`

### ⚠️ Minor Inconsistencies Found

| Location                                    | Issue                                                                 | Resolution                                             |
| ------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| `codebase_info.md` vs actual `package.json` | codebase_info lists Motion 12.17.0 (from steering), actual is 12.38.0 | Actual version in dependencies.md is correct (12.38.0) |
| `codebase_info.md` vs actual                | Lists react-query 5.89.0 (from steering), actual is 5.100.10          | dependencies.md has correct version                    |
| `codebase_info.md` vs actual                | Lists Fastify 5.3.2 (from steering), actual is 5.8.5                  | dependencies.md has correct version                    |
| `codebase_info.md` vs actual                | Lists Next.js 16.2.0 (from steering), actual is 16.2.6                | dependencies.md has correct version                    |

**Note**: The `codebase_info.md` tech stack table uses versions from the steering docs (`.kiro/steering/tech.md`), while `dependencies.md` uses actual `package.json` values. The steering docs appear slightly outdated. **Recommendation**: Use `dependencies.md` as the source of truth for exact versions.

## Completeness Check

### ✅ Well-Documented Areas

- Backend service layer (all 12 services documented with responsibilities)
- Database schema (all 12 models, all fields, all indexes)
- API endpoints (comprehensive REST + WebSocket coverage)
- Workflows (12 key flows with sequence diagrams)
- Security architecture (auth, RBAC, encryption, rate limiting)
- Deployment pipeline (CI/CD, blue-green, rollback)
- Offline-first architecture (IndexedDB, sync, conflict resolution)

### 🔍 Language Support Gaps

- **No gaps** — The entire codebase is TypeScript/JavaScript, which is fully supported for analysis
- Shell scripts in `scripts/` and `docs/deployment/cloudflare/scripts/` are documented at a high level but individual script logic is not detailed (acceptable — they are deployment utilities)

## Recommendations

1. **Version source of truth**: Update `.kiro/steering/tech.md` to match actual `package.json` versions, or add a note in `codebase_info.md` directing readers to `dependencies.md` for exact versions
2. **Testing documentation**: Consider adding a `testing.md` file documenting the ~1149 tests, property-based testing patterns with fast-check, and mock strategies used across services
3. **Keep docs updated**: When adding new services, routes, or models, update the corresponding documentation file
4. **Cloudflare infrastructure**: The `docs/deployment/cloudflare/` directory contains significant infrastructure code (Workers, scripts) that could be documented in a separate `infrastructure.md`
