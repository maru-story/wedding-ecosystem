## Current Scale & Constraints

- **Events**: 1 event at a time (single-tenant usage for now)
- **Guests**: Maximum 500 guests per event
- **Concurrent users**: Low (peak ~50 simultaneous check-ins during event)
- **Infrastructure implication**: Single Redis instance is sufficient for both cache and pub/sub. No need for horizontal scaling, multi-instance WebSocket, or separate pub/sub database at this scale.
- **Growth path**: If scaling to multiple concurrent events or 1000+ guests, revisit Redis separation, auto-scaling, and connection pooling decisions.
- **Environment strategy**: Production only (no staging). Validation via Vercel preview deployments (frontend) and CI/CD pipeline (automated tests + security scan). Rollback via blue-green deployment if issues found in production.

## Core Domain Rules

1. **Tenant isolation** — Every query scoped by `tenant_id`. Never expose data across tenants.
2. **Personalized URLs** — Format: `/{event-slug}?to={guest-slug}`. The `guest-slug` determines which name appears on the cover.
3. **QR uniqueness** — One QR code per guest per event. Payload encrypted with `guest_id` + `event_id`.
4. **Duplicate detection** — Prevent duplicate check-ins. Second scan shows warning with first check-in timestamp.
5. **Go-Show flow** — Unregistered guests added on-site by Scanner Operators. Temporary record, no QR code.
6. **CMS sections** — 14 configurable sections per invitation (cover, bride-groom, story, countdown, event-details, gallery, video, RSVP, wishes, gift, music, closing, navigation, footer). Each toggleable and reorderable.
7. **RSVP states** — `pending` | `confirmed` | `declined` | `checked_in`.
8. **Real-time broadcast** — Check-in and RSVP updates broadcast via WebSocket, scoped to event room.
9. **Offline queue** — Scanner stores actions locally when offline, syncs on reconnect. Conflict resolution: server timestamp wins.
10. **Event capacity** — Up to 500 guests per event without degradation.

## Business Logic Priorities

1. Data integrity (tenant isolation, no duplicate check-ins)
2. Offline reliability (Scanner must never lose a scan)
3. Performance (meet latency targets in tech.md)
4. User experience (smooth animations, clear feedback)
